# FPGA\_Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA design projects implemented in Verilog HDL using different modeling techniques. It is structured to help learners and developers understand the three fundamental abstraction levels of digital design: Gate-Level, Dataflow, and Behavioral modeling.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ **GATE LEVEL MODELING**

**PROJECTS:**

* 4-to-1 Multiplexer
* 4-bit Adder

### üìÅ **DATA FLOW MODELING**

**PROJECTS:**

* Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop
* 4-to-1 Multiplexer
* Ripple Counter
* T Flip-Flop

### üìÅ **BHEAVOURIAL MODELING**

**PROJECTS:**

* 4-to-1 Multiplexer


## Getting Started

To explore the projects:([GitHub][1])

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the modeling technique you're interested in
   You can find the source codes here (Example Data Flow Folder) <project_root>/data_flow_modeling/data_flow_modeling.srcs/sources_1/new
3. Open the Verilog files to review the code and understand the design implementations.
4. Use a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool to compile and test the designs.

## Prerequisites

To work with these projects, you'll need:

* An FPGA development environment (e.g., Xilinx Vivado)
* The Projects can be directly opened using Vivado 2024.1
* If you are simply intereseted in the Code you can naviagate to the sources for each folder

* Basic understanding of digital logic design and Verilog HDL
