# FPGA\_Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA design projects implemented in Verilog HDL using different modeling techniques. It is structured to help learners and developers understand the three fundamental abstraction levels of digital design: Gate-Level, Dataflow, and Behavioral modeling.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ **gate\_level\_Modeling**

Projects implemented using primitive gate instances. These demonstrate the most fundamental approach to digital circuit design.

**Contents:**

* 4-to-1 Multiplexer
* 4-bit Adder

---

### üìÅ **data\_flow\_modeling**

Projects that focus on the flow and manipulation of data between components using continuous assignments and logical expressions.

**Contents:**

* Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop
* 4-to-1 Multiplexer
* Ripple Counter
* T Flip-Flop

---

### üìÅ **bheavourial\_modeling**

Projects using high-level procedural constructs (`always`, `if`, `case`, etc.) to describe the behavior of digital systems.

**Contents:**

* 4-to-1 Multiplexer


## Getting Started

To explore the projects:([GitHub][1])

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the modeling technique you're interested in <project_root>/data_flow_modeling/data_flow_modeling.srcs/sources_1/new
2. Open the Verilog files to review the code and understand the design implementations.
3. Use a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool to compile and test the designs.

## Prerequisites

To work with these projects, you'll need:

* An FPGA development environment (e.g., Xilinx Vivado)
* The Projects can be directly opened using Vivado 2024.1
* If you are simply intereseted in the Code you can naviagate to the sources for each folder

* Basic understanding of digital logic design and Verilog HDL
