# FPGA_Projects

This repository contains a collection of FPGA design projects implemented using various modeling techniques in Verilog HDL. Each folder represents a different abstraction level of hardware design, providing a comprehensive understanding of digital system modeling.

## Repository Structure

* **gate\_level\_Modeling**: Projects that utilize basic logic gates to construct digital circuits. This folder demonstrates the foundational level of digital design, where circuits are built using primitive gate instances.

* **data\_flow\_modeling**: Contains designs that describe the flow of data between registers and the logical operations performed on that data. This modeling style emphasizes the movement and transformation of data within the system.

* **bheavourial\_modeling**: Includes projects that focus on the behavior of digital systems, using high-level constructs to describe complex functionalities. Behavioral modeling allows for a more abstract and flexible design approach.

## Getting Started

To explore the projects:([GitHub][1])

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the modeling technique you're interested in.

2. Open the Verilog files to review the code and understand the design implementations.

3. Use a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool to compile and test the designs.

## Prerequisites

To work with these projects, you'll need:

* An FPGA development environment (e.g., Xilinx Vivado)
* The Projects can be directly opened using Vivado 2024.1
* If you are simply intereseted in the Code you can naviagate to the sources for each folder

* Basic understanding of digital logic design and Verilog HDL
